# Printing Templates

Printing Templates are either PDF or XSL-FO based templates suitable to be letterheads, standard printouts like appointment or theatre lists.

Your CareRight installation contains a number of default templates; each may be overridden and customised.

See https://careright.knowledgeowl.com/help/default-printing-templates for more detail.
